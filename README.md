Some basic utils often missed within Javascript

usage examples that will work within the script or a webbrowser console of your choice and preference:

console.log('Just testing something really cool I guess.'.startsWith(''));
console.log("Contains Test: " + 'Does this contain this?'.contains('Does'));
console.log("Contains Test: " + '2'.contains(2));
var s = '';
console.log("EmptyString Test: " + s.emptyString());
